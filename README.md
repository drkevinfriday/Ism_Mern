 ## Description

For our group project, we built an app where people can share their stories overcoming types of -ISMs (racism, sexism, cissexism, and more) to connect and inspire action towards cultivating a world of diversity and inclusion. Currently, our app is still in development with a few features on the way including seeing all posts by category, functionality with our Post List, Reactions and adding Empaths (friends). 

We built Anti-ISM with the following:
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [MongoDB]()
* [React]()
* [React-Bootstrap]()
* [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
* [JSON Web Token]()
